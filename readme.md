## Local Development Environment

To run the site locally, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your machine. Once you have Docker installed, you can run the following command to start the site locally:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start the site locally and you should see output similar to the following:

```
website-docker-11ty-1  | [11ty] Writing dist/talks/2022/20220803-cybersecurity/index.html from ./src/talks/2022/20220803-cybersecurity.md (liquid)

```

You can then open your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the site!

_Note: The first time you run this container, it will take a few minutes to download the Docker image and install the dependencies. Be patient, and the environment will be ready once you see the output above._

_Note: If you are using Docker Desktop on Windows, you may need to add the project directory to the list of shared directories in Docker Desktop. See [this tutorial](https://dev.to/bogicevic7/windows-docker-shared-volume-folder-46d1)._
